print("1.) The main objective is to get the dealer's bank to 0. You can do this by beating the dealer to 21 or not 'busting'. If you 'bust' or the dealer 'bust' then credits are lost.")
print("2.) You play this game of Black Jack against the dealer. Both you and the dealer have 500 credits in your bank.")
print("3.) The dealer will deal both you and themself 2 cards. You cannot see the dealer's cards until one of you 'bust' or reach 21.")
print("4.) If you reach 21 and the dealer is under 21, then you will get 2x your bet and the dealer will lose their bet(the dealer's bet is equal to yours) and vice versa.")
print("5.) If you reach 21 and the dealer is over 21, then you get 4x your bet and the dealer loses 2x their bet and vice versa.")
print("6.) If you 'bust' and the dealer does not 'bust', you lose the amount you bet and the dealer gains the amount they bet and vice versa.")
print("7.) There are two options for this game when you are asked 'What do you want to do?'. You may 'hit'(ask for one more card) or 'stay' (keep your current value).")
print("8.) If you choose to stay and your value is closer to 21 than the dealer's, then you win 2x your bet and the dealer loses their bet and vice versa.")
